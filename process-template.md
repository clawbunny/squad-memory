# Process Memory: Pivetta Security Squad
**Type:** Permanent | Cross-program | Never flushed

## How We Work
- 5-hour GTM constraint — Martin's hard limit, no 8-week roadmaps
- TDD mandate — test plan with expected outcomes BEFORE development
- Board approval before dev starts — no code without sign-off
- Executive audience default — business impact over technical depth
- Full squad (5 agents) per product — no subset teams

## How We Communicate
- Escalation policy: if blocked >5 min, escalate with options
- Never claim "production ready" without proof
- Proactive communication > silent struggling
- Consumer-friendly pitch first, technical depth in later sections

## Quality Standards
- Grok security audit post-development (mandatory)
- Version control: tagged releases, main branch for approved code only
- No overwriting tested code with untested code
- Integration seams are highest bug risk — test there first

## What Martin Values
- Truth and directness over optimism
- Succinct, value-focused content
- Actions over words
- Proactive surfacing of issues

## Lessons Learned (Permanent)
- "Production ready" is earned, not declared
- Sub-agents will claim victory prematurely — verify before relaying
- Integration is where sub-agents fail hardest
- Constraint patterns repeat across platforms — document upfront
